  "description": "Reroll is a mod designed to completely reroll or reset a player. It will remove their inventory, achievements, etc. and teleport them far away to simulate a completely new world. This is great for hardcore style modpacks that don't want to create new worlds for every reset. It works in single player and on servers.",
